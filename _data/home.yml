    text: The Hermes is a configurable, 2m (~6.5 ft) fixed-wing drone that is engineered to meet the demands 
          of serious drone pilots. When the job is big and multirotors on the market just won't get 
          it done, turn to the Hermes.

    text: We all know it, fixed-wing drones are more stressful 
          to control than multi-rotor counterparts. The Hermes has state-of-the-art 
          avionics and environment monitoring making it capable of autonomous flights, 
          takeoff to landing. Our drone was designed to be thrown, or launched from a passive launch ramp. 
          Every Hermes comes with a parachute for safe, stress free landings, which combined with the short takeoff capabilities means Hermes does not need a huge clearing to operate, making planning easier.

    text: What good is a drone without a useful flight time and range? </br> Hermes comes standard with a 4-hour flight time at cruise speeds between 35-45 MPH. 
          Our drone was engineered with high winds in mind, with a maximum windspeed rating of 30 MPH you can work with confidence with less downtime. 
          We provide a standard 5 mile range, but the maximum control range can be configured to be up to 30 miles.

    text: The Hermes was designed with redundancy in mind. Every Hermes is equipped with a barometer, two compasses, GPS positioning, 3 inertial measurement units, telemetry downlinks, battery and power monitors, redundant avionics power, and an array of other internal sensing abilities. 
          Hermes can be configured to include a vertical rangefinder, airspeed sensors, flow sensors, and ADSB receivers with automatic collision avoidance. 
          Physical safety was not overlooked either, Hermes can fly on one motor, or with one non-functioning control surface in an emergency.  
          In the case of an emergency, Hermes will auto deploy the parachute, even if that emergency was a total loss of power, it will still deploy the chute.
