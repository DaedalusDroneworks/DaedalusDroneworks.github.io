    text: Our founders, Omar and Avery, have over a decade of combined experience building 
          and designing drones. Together, they recognized that fixed-wing drones have been greatly 
          underdeveloped and saught out to bring together a diverse team to solve this problem. We hope 
          that our new drone will help expand the use of aerial surverying and improve the outcomes of users 
          in the agriculture and energy.
